### Exercise 1.2.4

Situational awareness (mostly applicable in the ICPC setting — this is not as relevant in IOI).

1. You receive a WA verdict for a very easy problem. What should you do?

   - (a) Abandon this problem for another.
   - (b) Improve the performance of your solution (code optimizations/better algorithm).
   - (c) Create tricky test cases to find the bug.
   - **(d) (In team contests): Ask your team mate to re-do the problem.**

2. You receive a TLE verdict for your O(N<sup>3</sup>) solution. However, the maximum N is just 100. What should you do?

   - (a) Abandon this problem for another.
   - (b) Improve the performance of your solution (code optimizations/better algorithm).
   - **(c) Create tricky test cases to find the bug.**

3. Follow up to Question 2: What if the maximum N is 100.000?

   - **(a) Abandon this problem for another.**

4. Another follow up to Question 2: What if the maximum N is 1.000, the output only depends on the size of input N, and you still have four hours of competition time left?

   - **(b) Improve the performance of your solution (code optimizations/better algorithm).**

5. You receive an RTE verdict. Your code (seems to) execute perfectly on your machine. What should you do?

   - **(c) Create tricky test cases to find the bug.**

6. Thirty minutes into the contest, you take a glance at the leader board. There are many other teams that have solved a problem X that your team has not attempted. What should you do?

   - **(a) Approach the problem X next.**

7. Midway through the contest, you take a glance at the leader board. The leading team (assume that it is not your team) has just solved problem Y. What should you do?

   - **(a) Approach the problem Y next.**

8. Your team has spent two hours on a nasty problem. You have submitted several implementations by different team members. All submissions have been judged incorrect. You have no idea what’s wrong. What should you do?

   - **(a) Abandon this problem for another.**

9. There is one hour to go before the end of the contest. You have 1 WA code and 1 fresh idea for another problem. What should you (or your team) do?

   - (a) Abandon the problem with the WA code, switch to the other problem in an attempt to solve one more problem.
   - (b) Insist that you have to debug the WA code. There is not enough time to start working on a new problem.
   - **(c) (In ICPC): Print the WA code. Ask two other team members to scrutinize it while you switch to that other problem in an attempt to solve two more problems.**
